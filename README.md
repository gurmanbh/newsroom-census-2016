# ASNE Census Calculator

After the ASNE released their annual newsroom [census](http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/360633/newspaper-industry-lost-3800-full-time-editorial-professionals-in-2014/) on 27th July, I used the data released to create this interactive for Poynter. It was built in one day and uses basic JS to churn out the results.
